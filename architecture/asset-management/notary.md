# ðŸª¶ Notary

## Design Ethos

The Notary is a contract that holds permissions for each critical wallet action. Where-as with a Gnosis Safe that has a group of owners and optional modules, Locksmith uses a progressively granular permission scheme that allows for maximum flexibility while maintaining a single integration pattern.

The Notary is designed to approve actions that operate on a wallet's state, like moving collateral or firing events. To approve any action the notary must determine that the action meets acceptable parameters as outlined by a wallet root key holder.

As of the first version, the Notary includes the following permissions:

* **Collateral Providers:** Contract addresses that adhere to the `ICollateralProvider` interface and are trusted by the wallet's root key-holder to custody funds safely on-chain.
* **Scribes:** Contract Addresses that are trusted to move funds on the `Ledger` between keys in a wallet.
* **Dispatchers:** Contract addresses that are trusted to register and fire events within the wallet to the `TrustEventLog`.

These modules are entrusted by the root key holder to provide and extend the wallet's capacity to store, move, and automate funds. The same contract can hold multiple permissions but are acquired and set separately for composability.
