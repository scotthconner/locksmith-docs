# ðŸ“½ Introduction

## Solution Space

In order to make progress on the usability and security challenges of managing crypto-based assets, we need to change the relationship between private keys and access to crypto assets.

A novel solution would then have the following traits:

1. **On-chain.** Do not rely on centralized off-chain actors, companies, custodial outfits, "Web2" based services, servers, or deployments.
2. **Self custodial.** Maintain full control of and visibility into your assets at all times without enabling long standing approval permissions.
3. **Recoverable.** Losing a private key, or leaving crypto-assets as inheritance through a will needs to be secure and reliable. This includes cases where assets are staked, locked up, loaned, borrowed, etc.
4. **Extensible.** Users should not be limited in what they can do, and should enable others to securely interact with their funds. ****&#x20;

## Introducing Locksmith Smart Wallet

The Locksmith Smart Wallet is built of composable units that orchestrate into a secure on-chain, fully self custody wallet with programmable traits.

### Key Management

Instead of requiring a private key signature with assets in-wallet to do business, the Locksmith Wallet provides access to deposits, withdrawal, distributions, delegation access, and event triggering through the valid possession of a specific [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) NFT token.

The wallet is created when a user creates their own **root** key. A root key holder has unilateral permission to manage the full life-cycle of other keys:

1. **Create:** Root key holders can create additional unique ERC-1155 keys to hold, or distribute to others, or embed into contracts.&#x20;
2. **Copy:** Root key holders can copy any existing or extinct keys.
3. **Burn:** They can burn any currently minted key.&#x20;
4. **Soulbind:** Root key holders can bind keys to holders use that the key cannot be moved, sent, or stolen.

Keys can be held by end users in traditional wallets, ledgers, browser plug-ins, or any on-chain contract willing to accept and hold it for use.
