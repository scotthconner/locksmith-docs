# ðŸ“½ Introduction

## Solution Space

In order to make progress on the usability and security challenges of managing crypto-based assets, we need to change the relationship between private keys and access to crypto assets.

A novel solution would then have the following traits:

1. **On-chain.** Do not rely on centralized off-chain actors, companies, custodial outfits, "Web2" based services, servers, or deployments.
2. **Self custodial.** Maintain full control of and visibility into your assets at all times without enabling long standing approval permissions.
3. **Recoverable.** Losing a private key, or leaving crypto-assets as inheritance through a will needs to be secure and reliable.
4. **Extensible.** Users should not be limited in what they can do, and should enable others to securely interact with your funds. ****&#x20;
